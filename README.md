# local_audio_visualizer

An HTML5 experiment.

Drag an audio file to the browser window. It will be played directly from your hard disk, and you'll have a neat spectrum visualization.

Here is [the demo](http://cbrandolino.github.com/local-audio-visualizer)

## Status

At the moment, there's just enough to make it work.

I will add more comments, a better css and some tutorial-ish documentation as soon as I get some sleep.

It works well on the latest Chrome; possibly on Safari too.

## HTML5 features showcased

- **Web Audio Api** (for playback and analysis)
- **File access** (for local playback)
- **Native drag and drop** (for, you know, drag and drop)
- **Canvas and css transforms** (for the things you see)
